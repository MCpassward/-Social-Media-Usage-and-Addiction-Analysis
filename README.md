# Social Media Addiction Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores how different factors like time spent, platform used, and user satisfaction contribute to social media addiction. Using a public dataset and big data techniques, we aim to analyze behavior and build a model to predict addiction levels.
##  üéØProject Objective

Main Goal:
To assess how social media usage patterns influence user productivity using data analytics techniques.

Specific Objectives:

Identify key behavioral factors linked to productivity loss.
Analyze platform usage and time-related metrics.
Predict productivity impact using machine learning models.
Recommend actionable solutions to mitigate negative effects.
