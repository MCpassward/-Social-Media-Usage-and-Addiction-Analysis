# Social Media Addiction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores how different factors like time spent, platform used, and user satisfaction contribute to social media addiction. Using a public dataset and big data techniques, we aim to analyze behavior and build a model to predict addiction levels.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Here](https://github.com/haneesha-thasni/Time-wasters-on-social-media-Analysis/blob/main/Time-Wasters%20on%20Social%20Media.csv)
- Features: Age, Gender, Platform usage, Time spent, Satisfaction, Addiction Level, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- 📒 Google Colab (Python for data processing and modeling)
- 📊 Power BI (for dashboard visualization)
- 📁 GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

## 🔍 Methodology
- Data cleaning and exploration using Google Colab
- Built machine learning models (Predicted addiction level, matrix)
- Identified key features that influence addiction
- Created interactive Power BI dashboard with trends and correlations

## ✅ Key Results
- Model Accuracy: **0.8734**
- Top predictors:Time Spent On Video, Scroll Rate, Self Control
- Dashboard visualizations highlight addictive patterns by platform and demographic

## 💡 Recommendations
- Platforms should implement time-limit features
- Awareness campaigns targeted to heavy users
- Productivity apps to monitor daily usage

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `/data`: Raw and cleaned data
- `/colab_notebook`: Google Colab .ipynb files
- `/Powerbi`: Dashboard file (.pbix)
