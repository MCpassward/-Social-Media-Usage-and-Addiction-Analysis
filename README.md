# Social Media Addiction Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores how different factors like time spent, platform used, and user satisfaction contribute to social media addiction. Using a public dataset and big data techniques, we aim to analyze behavior and build a model to predict addiction levels.

## üìä Dataset
